# cppexercises
Several exercises for practice. 
## Library Management: Created admin and user panel. Books, users and admin info is saved in local text file. Nothing fancy, just trying to get used to OOP structures.

## Linear Algebra: Second exercise for OOP practice. Created Matrix class and added severeal linear algebra tool.
# Features

- **LU Decomposition**: It doesn't work; however, I kept it for future implementations.
- **QR Decomposition**: I implemented QR decomposition, however for N x N matrices where N > 100, it doesn't produce a good result.
- **Random Matrix Generation**: For testing, pseudo-random matrices with elements between -10.0 and 10.0 are generated.
- **Error Calculation**: Calculates the error of the decompositions by taking the element-wise difference.

I created a test for random matrices' QR decomposition errors.
